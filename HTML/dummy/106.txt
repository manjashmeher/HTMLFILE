Sachin started playing cricket under the influence of his brother Ajit. He played under the supervision of the coach Ramakant Achrekar who saw potential in him from the very start of his game. Soon, his popularity in cricket started growing as he took part in school crickets as well as cricket tournaments of the premium clubs. 

It is said that his coach used to inspire him by offering Re 1 coin to the bowlers who could dismiss Sachin. On the other hand, if Sachin played the whole session, the coach would give the coin to him. Even today, Sachin has 13 such coins with him and he mentions them to be the most prized possession of his entire career.

The Career Glimpse
Sachin’s career in cricket started when he was selected for Ranji Trophy in the session 1987 – 1988. But here he was not in the final eleven players but was selected as a substitute. The chance of playing with his idol Sunil Gavaskar missed out as Gavaskar retired in the very year of 1987. 

Soon, Sachin was selected by Dilip Vengsarkar and Sachin thanked him by scoring a century in the tournaments Duleep Trophy and Deodhar Trophy. 

Sachin also scored the highest in his team for the Ranji Trophy of 1988 – 1989. He showed his century even in the Irani Trophy. He was soon selected for the England tour under the banner of Star Cricket Clubs in the year 1988 and 1989 consecutively. 

The Master Blaster increased his level and hit his first double century in 1998 at the Brabourne Stadium against Australia. But he considers that his double century against the team of Tamil Nadu during the Ranji Trophy of the year 2000 is the best innings of his entire career. 

He played for six world cups between the years 1992 and 2011. It was in the year 2011 when finally the country came up with the second World Cup Trophy after the first being in the year 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. 

The right-handed batsman made his ODI debut in the year 1989 at Jinnah Stadium against Pakistan. Coincidently, he played his last ODI match also against Pakistan in the year 2012 but this time at Shere Bangla National Stadium.
